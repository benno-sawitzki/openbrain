# Open Brain — Provider Configuration
#
# Place this file at openbrain.yaml (next to the marketing/ data directory)
# to configure which services power each dashboard slot.
#
# Without this file, Open Brain auto-detects CLI tools (.taskpipe/, .leadpipe/, .contentq/).
# With this file, explicit config wins over auto-detection.

providers:
  tasks: taskpipe           # taskpipe (default), todoist, github, linear
  crm: leadpipe             # leadpipe (default), pipedrive, hubspot
